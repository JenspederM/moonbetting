# Moonbetting

Hi  

As we agreed earlier I will set aside 10 hours to build a predictive model that can identify value bets in the European football betting market. I plan on creating a model that will output calibrated probabilities of each outcome of a match (1 X 2). 

I understand that MoonBetting's strategy will be to place bets when the probability of a particular outcome implied by the current odds is lower than what is predicted by my model.

If you can provide me with match data (as much data as possible available before kickoff) it would be greatly appreciated. Any time that I must spend wrangling data will of course reduce the quality of my model. Many kinds of data could be useful, but I hypothesize that the transfer value of the players involved in a match will inform the model a lot. In order to backtest the model I will also need the market odds for each match.

I would like to receive a python project with a single .ipynb file that I can execute to reproduce the pipeline here on earth. It needs to be fast and efficient and please keep the size of the project as small as possible.

Best regards,
Dr. Datawiz
